# Platform
The development environment is Windows.

# Shell constraints
All terminal commands must be compatible with Windows PowerShell and cmd.exe.
Do NOT use '&&', ';', or Unix-style command chaining.
Do NOT assume bash, zsh, or sh.

# Command execution rules
When multiple commands are required:
- Use separate commands on separate lines, OR
- Use PowerShell syntax (e.g.:
  if ($?) { <command> }
)

# Path rules
- Use Windows paths (C:\, backslashes)
- Avoid /usr, /bin, ~/.config, etc.

# Tooling assumptions
- Assume PowerShell is the primary shell
- Avoid Linux-only utilities (sed, awk, grep, rm -rf, cp -r)
- Prefer PowerShell equivalents (Remove-Item, Copy-Item, Get-ChildItem)

# If a command differs between Windows and Unix:
- Provide a Windows-specific command
- Or explain the alternative instead of guessing
